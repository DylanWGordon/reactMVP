    return <p>Yo! I'm Kane usually, but on the internet I'm often FieryRamen.

        I have been interested in art for as long as I can remember. *[My first ever piece was one I call â€˜The Baby Got into the Paints'.]

        I occasionally teach a children's character design class at my local library.

        I draw a lot of fantasy and my art style has been heavily inspired by cartoons and anime I grew up watching.

        My goals would be to become a professional character designer, but I would also just be so happy to do commissions for people wanting their D&D characters and OCs illustrated for them. I love bringing characters to life and seeing how happy it makes people.

        Thanks for checking me out!</p>
