            Yo!<br></br>
            <p className='indent'>I'm Kane usually, but on the internet I'm often FieryRamen.
            
        I have been interested in art for as long as I can remember, and
                I occasionally teach a children's character design class at my local library.
            </p>
                <p className='indent'>I draw a lot of fantasy and my art style has been heavily inspired by cartoons and anime I grew up watching.

                My goal is to become a professional character designer, but I would also just be so happy to do commissions for people wanting their D&D characters and OCs illustrated for them. I love bringing characters to life and seeing how happy it makes people.</p>
            
                <p className='end'>
                Thanks for checking me out!</p>
